# About

I'm Gabe Wong. There's nothing special about me. I explore what I like: Programming, Mathematics, Digital media. I've been involved in my fair share of school-sponsored clubs: TSA, Model UN, and Social Justice Club.

This website is a collection of my best works in the fields of digital media and programming.
